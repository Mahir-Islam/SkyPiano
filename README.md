# Sky Piano
This is a small program that emulates the instrument user interface found in the popular video game Sky Children of the Light.

You can also use your keyboard to play music. The first five keys on each letter row of the QWERTY keyboard correspond to different musical notes. By default, the program is set to C-Major, but you can use the right and left arrow keys to shift the scale up or down.

The program utilizes the open-source Google Font called Lato Regular for its font style. You can find more information about this font at: https://developers.google.com/fonts#:~:text=All%20fonts%20are%20released%20under,non%2Dcommercial%20or%20commercial%20project.
The audio files used in the program are sampled from BeepBox.
